# RockPaperScissors-game
Odin Project redo project

##Progress

using what i learnt from the first Odin Project rock paper scissors game i decided to make a redo using what i learnt from that first project as i faced many challenges in it.

i was able to crete the game manipulating the DOM as well now

## What i learnt 
i should not invoke functions when i do if statements it will mess up code execution or repeat it
